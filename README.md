# GRID2000
CSS grid for micromanaging perfectionists

Have you ever come across a problem where on between certain pixels of viewport your grid would just jumps to the next line but since that problem happens only on out of the traditional viewport scope most likely defined by the framework that you are using (such as SM, MD, LG...) you really can't do anything but to overwrite media queries in order to solve that problem? Well thats where GRID2000 shines, GRID2000 is determined to solve these kind of tiny little troubles by instead of having a fixed viewport scope classes for devices, it has pixel definitions from 200px to 2000px with 50px step. This grants you to define the exact grid that you want for exact screen size.

GRID2000 also comes with ratio classes (in between 1x1 to 12x12) which significantly increases the file size
